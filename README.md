## Introduction

This React application serves as a Recipe Gallery, showcasing a curated list of recipes with their titles, ingredients, and images. The project emphasizes the use of React for rendering static data, focusing on list rendering techniques without involving state management or interactivity. The design employs modern web development practices to ensure the gallery is both visually appealing and responsive.

This command runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
Layout and Styling Choices
Layout

The Recipe Gallery utilizes a grid layout to display recipe cards in a flexible and responsive manner. This layout adjusts to screen size, ensuring an attractive presentation across devices. Each card represents a recipe, displaying its title, ingredients list, and an image.
Styling

Styling choices were made with the goals of clarity, user-friendliness, and aesthetic appeal in mind:

    CSS Variables: Simplify theme management, making it easier to adjust colors, spacing, and effects.
    Grid System: Provides a responsive structure, allowing the gallery to adapt to different screen sizes gracefully.
    Card Design: Recipe cards use box shadows and rounded corners for a modern, polished look. Ingredients are listed with bullet points for easy readability.
    Responsive Design: Ensures that the gallery is accessible and looks great on both large and small screens.

Colors and Typography

    A soft color palette was chosen to create a warm and welcoming feel.
    Typography is clear and accessible, enhancing the overall readability of the recipes.
